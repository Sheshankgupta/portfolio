    <p>First of all, I would like to thank you for visiting and giving some of your precious time to get to know about
      me.</p>

    <p>Throughout my career till now, I have worked on various projects, ranging from small business websites to
      large-scale web applications. I am proficient in modern frameworks like Angular and Ionic, and I have a good
      understanding of responsive design principles to ensure optimal user experience across different devices. Apart
      from front-end technologies, I also have a solid understanding of back-end technologies like PHP and Python. I
      have developed many back-end solutions using Laravel and have sound knowledge of WordPress as well. Additionally,
      I am familiar with relational databases and NoSQL databases. I have utilized Git/GitHub as a versioning tool for
      my projects and have experience working with Jira software. Moreover, I have knowledge of VanillaJS, AJAX, and
      jQuery.</p>

    <p>What sets me apart is my passion for coding and attention to detail. I strive to write well-structured,
      maintainable, and easily modifiable code, following best practices and industry standards. I am always eager to
      learn and explore new technologies as I believe continuous learning is crucial in the ever-evolving field of web
      development.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy attending tech conferences, participating in hackathons, and contributing to open-source
      projects. These activities not only help me expand my knowledge but also allow me to connect with like-minded
      professionals and give back to the developer community. In my leisure time, I enjoy playing chess, playing Clash
      of Clans (a mobile game), meeting new people, traveling, and indulging in my passion for poetry and storytelling.
